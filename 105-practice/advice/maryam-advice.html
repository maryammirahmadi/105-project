                <h4>Confusion is a lie!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is an unproductive feeling rooted in an unmanaged mind. Choose a productive thought - perhaps that you are heading in the right direction - and confusion ceases to exist. "I'm confused about this material," becomes "I am in a problem solving pursuit of math and technology and it's time for me to dig deeper and keep going."</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
